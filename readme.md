The devigging methods are described in https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/implied/vignettes/introduction.html:
- Basic (Multiplicative)
- Power
- Additive
- Shin

Implementations of the first 3 are inspired by https://github.com/ian-shepherd/pybettor, and the 
shin method is taken from https://github.com/mberk/shin.
